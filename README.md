# Unreal-Engine-Projects
Games learned and created with the guidance from a Udemy course.

These projects were originally created in an earlier version of Unreal Engine (v.5.6) as part of a Udemy course for personal practice and learning.

Due to engine version changes, the project currently may not compile or open correctly in UE 5.7 without migration work.

It is shared for portfolio purposes to demonstrate:
- Game design implementation
- Blueprint system logic
- Project structure
- Prototyping approach
- Basic AI behavior tree skills

Video demos of the working version are provided in the repository / linked below.
